# How to config token and prefix?
1.Go to index.js and scroll down until you find token if it's saying `process.env.token` put your token in secrets in replit,if your not in replit replace `process.env.token` to `token: ""`
and put your own token

2.Below the token setup,you will find prefix named: `$getGuildVar[prefix]`
you may need to put your own token in variables which will be found in `Other Useful Cmds` Directory

Thats All!
